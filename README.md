# Lore

Lore is a simple web-based AI chat application built fully on client-side. To use, you need to configure your own API keys.

The idea behind this project is to provide a better way to roleplay with AI models, by using prompt and context engineering to create a more realistic and engaging experience, similar to how you would interact with a human.

The project is still in development and has only basic chat features implemented, but as name suggests, the goal is to create an app where you can build your own **Lore**.
